BayesianKit - Cocoa Objective-C Framework for a naive bayesian classifier
=========================================================================

BayesianKit is a Mac OS X Framework written by Samuel Mendes in Objective-C 2.0
and released under BSD 3-clauses license. BayesianKit offers a simple, ready to
use, implementation for a bayesian classifier. A command line utility is also
provided.

Dependencies
------------

* [ParseKit](http://parsekit.com) used for the default tokenizer
* [appledoc](http://www.gentlebytes.com/freeware/appledoc) used to generate the
 headers' documentation

Both of them are included as submodules. After having cloned the repository
type:

	git submodule init
	git submodule update

However appledoc needs [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen) which is
not provided.

Xcode Project
-------------

The BayesianKit project consists of 3 targets:

- **BayesianKit** : The BayesianKit framework.
- **Bayes** : The command line utility.
- **Install Documentation** : The script running appledoc.

BayesianKit usage
-----------------

The default classifier comes with a tokenizer based on ParseKit. Quite efficient
when training on source code. It also implements and use the Robinson-Fisher
combiner on probabilities. Both the tokenizer and combiner can be changed,
however note that they are not saved along the training. Hence if you load a
classifier from a file, you must reset the tokenizer and/or combiner.

### Creating and Training a new classifier ###

	BKClassifier *classifier = [[BKClassifier alloc] init];
	[classifier trainWithString:@"one two three four five"
	               forPoolNamed:@"english"];
	[classifier trainWithString:@"un deux trois quatre cinq"
	               forPoolNamed:@"french"];
  
### Saving and reloading the training data ###

	[classifier writeToFile:@"counting.bks"]
	// Another day, in a different process
	BKClassifier *anotherOne;
	anotherOne = [BKClassifier classifierWithContentsOfFile:@"counting.bks"];

### Using the classifier to make a guess ###

	NSDictionary *results = [anotherOne guessWithString:@"three platypuses"];
	NSLog(@"%@", results);

The output is:

	$ {
	  english = "0.9999";
	}

This tool was intended to test quickly the classifier, and works only with
files. A manpage is also provided with every details.

### Installation ###
  
From the root directory of the project:

	sudo cp build/Release/bayes /usr/local/bin/
	sudo cp docs/man/man1/bayes.1 /usr/local/share/man/man1/

### Training with a save file ###

	bayes -f save.bks -s -t english shakespeare.txt -t french moliere.txt

### Guessing based on this training ###
  
	bayes -f save.bks -g mystery.txt
