The following train a classifier to learn 
.Ar english
on 
.Ar shakespeare.txt 
and saves it in
.Ar classifier.bks .
.Dl Nm Fl f Pa classifier.bks Fl s Fl t Pa english Pa shakespeare.txt
.Pp
We can reuse the previous training as long as we keep
.Ar classifier.bks .
To train it some more:
.Dl Nm Fl f Pa classifier.bks Fl s Fl t Pa french Pa moliere.txt
.Pp
To ask the classifier to which language belongs
.Ar mystery.txt :
.Dl Nm Fl f Pa classifier.bks Fl g Pa mystery.txt
.Pp
Wildcards can also be used:
.Dl Nm Fl f Pa classifier.bks Fl g Pa mysteries*
.Pp
To try a guess with a modified training, but without overwritting
.Ar classifier.bks :
.Dl Nm Fl f Pa classifier.bks Fl t Pa italian Pa dante.txt Fl g Pa mystery.txt
.Pp
The options 
.Ar file
and
.Ar save
are processed in priority and can be placed anywhere.
Saving will only be done just before a sucessful exit.
The options
.Ar train ,
.Ar guess and
.Ar strip
